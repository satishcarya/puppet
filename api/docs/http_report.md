Report
======
This document describes the Puppet master's report endpoint and the schema for
Report Format 6 in technical term. Also see the
[documentation](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/format_report.html).

The `report` endpoint allows clients to send reports to the master via `http`
or `https`. Once received by the master they are processed by the *report
processors* configured to be triggered when a report is received. As an
example, storing reports in PuppetDB is handled by one such report processor.

Save
----
The http(s) endpoint for sending reports to the master is:

    PUT /puppet/v3/report/:nodename?environment=:environment

### Supported HTTP Methods

PUT

### Supported Format(s)

`application/json`, `text/pson`

### Parameters

None

### Content

The content of a report is typically generated by the Puppet Runtime and consists of a JSON serialization of `Puppet::Transaction::Report` object which in turn contains a structure of objects with of the following runtime types:

* `Puppet::Util::Log`
* `Puppet::Util::Metric`
* `Puppet::Resource::Status`
* `Puppet::Transaction::Event`

This JSON serialization is compliant with the endpoint's report JSON schema.

Example
-------
Here is an example of a PUT request. (Note that the content-length is not correct as the
example is formatted for readability)

    PUT /puppet/v3/report/kermit.com?environment=production HTTP/1.0
