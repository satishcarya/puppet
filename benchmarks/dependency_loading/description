Benchmark scenario: call of local and global functions in modules appointed by dependencies
Benchmark target: module loaders

A large number of modules are generated. Each module contains a global and a local function.
A subset of the modules declares a dependency to another module in their metadata.json and
has an init.pp which contains calls to the global and local function that resides in the
module appointed by the dependency.

The objective is to measure the difference between having loaders traversing dependencies
first or disregard the dependencies altogether (traverse all).
