Benchmark scenario: many functions spread across many modules.
Benchmark target: function loading and call overhead

A number of modules are generated. The environment, and each module holds a large number of functions (several 100s).
Fuctions call each other and cause deep recursion (and on demand loading as they are called.
Calls are made across modules, and to the environment.
